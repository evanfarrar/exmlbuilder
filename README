This is a small Erlang application for taking a specially formed Erlang tuple and translating it to XML. This might be useful for crafting XMMP responses or generating RSS or XHTML webpages. This was heavily inspired by markaby and builder, two ruby gems which fill a similar purpose.

Here is an example:
 xml:build(
      {iq,[{type,set},{id,auth}],
        {'query',[{xmlns,'jabber:iq:auth'}],
          [{username,e},
           {password,e},
           {resource,'TelnetClient'}]
        }
      }).

Would return a string with the following XML:
<iq type=\"set\" id=\"auth\">
  <query xmlns=\"jabber:iq:auth\">
    <username>e</username>
    <password>e</password>
    <resource>TelnetClient</resource>
  </query>
</iq>

Tuples first atom are translated into tags, and the second item in the tuple is a list of attributes, and the last item is interpreted as the body of the XML tag.

TODO: package this up for faxien.
